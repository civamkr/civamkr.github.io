## Welcome!

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics](https://acms.nd.edu) , [University of Notre Dame](https://acms.nd.edu). I work under the supervision of [Prof. Lizhen Lin](https://blog.umd.edu/lizhen01/) and [Prof. Daren Wang](https://darenwang.github.io/website).

Previously, I obtained my Integrated M.Sc. in Mathematics from Visva Bharati Santiniketan, India, where I was advised by [Prof. Swapan Kumar Pandit](https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/SwapanKumarPandit.html). I completed my master's dissertation at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Issan Patri](https://www.isid.ac.in/~statmath/index.php?module=Faculty).

A copy of my [CV](https://github.com/civamkr/website/blob/main/CV_Shivam_Kumar_OCT_2024.pdf) can be found here.

I was born and raised in Bihar, India.



## Research

My  research interests include:
- Statistical foundations of deep generative models
